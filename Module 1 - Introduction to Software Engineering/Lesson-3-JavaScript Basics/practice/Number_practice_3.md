```js
// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value

let age = 25
console.log(age) //25
 
// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable


// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together

let apple = 10
console.log(apple)

let grape = 5
console.log(grape)

console. log ("add together two numbers")
console. log (apple+grape)

// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest



// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other


// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other


// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console


// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?
```

```output
25
10
5
add together two numbers
